# Standard Notes Excalidraw Plugin

This is a drawing editor that uses [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

## This plugin is now built into Standard Notes

In Standard Notes, Go to Settings -> Plugins to install it.

The built-in plugins are at: https://github.com/standardnotes/plugins

If you already have the Excalidraw plugin installed before it was listed in Standard Notes, you have two options:
1. Keep using the manually installed plugin (there is currently no difference in functionality)
2. Uninstall the manually installed plugin, and install the built-in plugin. You will have to change the editor type of each Excalidraw note.
